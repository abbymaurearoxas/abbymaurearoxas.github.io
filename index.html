                <p>Loki is the God of Mischief, an expert liar and trickster. He is a charming, unpredictable,
                    spontaneous, cunning, gifted, and extremely intelligent man. He is often devilish, and many times
                    betrayed even his loved ones to achieve his own goals, but he eventually proves himself as a
                    good-hearted individual. Loki is motivated by his love for Thor and his desire for redemption for
                    his criminal past. All of this, along with his overwhelming ambition means that he never surrenders.
